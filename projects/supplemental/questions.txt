-------------- FOR Loops --------------

1)  Write code that prints out the numbers 1 through 10
2)  Write code that prints out the numbers 5 through 49
3)  Write code that prompts the user for a number and prints out the numbers 0 through their number
4)  Write code that prints out all even numbers between 1 and 100
5)  Write code that prints out all odd numbers between 1 and 100
6)  Write code that prints out all numbers between 1 and 100 that are multiples of 3
7)  Write code that prompts user for a string and print out each character of that string
8)  Write code that prompts user for 5 objects and use them to create a list. Then, print out each item in the list

-------------- WHILE Loops --------------

9-16) Do the above problems using a while loop instead of a for loop

** HINTS! **
  - Try initializing a separate variable (i=0, char_i=0, etc) to use as an iterator
  - If stuck, you can always simply use an infinite while loop (while True:) combined with an if/else to break out

 -------------- IF/ELSE Conditions --------------

17) Write code that prompts the user for their age. If the number is less than 4, print "You're a baby". Otherwise, print "You're not a baby"
18) Write code that prompts the user for their age. 
    If < 4, print "You're a baby"
    If between 4 and 18, print "You're still growing"
    If > 18, print "You're an adult"
19) Write code that prompts the user for their age and height (in feet).
    If their age is < 12 print "You're still growing"
    Otherwise, if their height is > 6.5 ft, print "You're super tall"
20) Write code that prompts the user for their age and height (in feet).
    If their age is < 12 print "You're still growing"
    Otherwise, if their age is > 12 and their height is less than 4 ft, print "You might be a dwarf"
    Otherwise, if their age is > 12 and their height is greater than 6.5 ft, print "You're super tall"
    If none of the conditions are met, print "Guess you're average"

-------------- Lists/Dictionaries --------------
Create the following list: (apple, salad, chips, cake, yogurt, peppers, wine)

21) Print out the 3rd item in the list
22) Print out the 4th item in the list
23) Print out the last item in the list
24) Prompt the user for a number between [0-6] and print out that item in the list
25) Prompt the user for two numbers between [0-6] and print out those two items in the list
26) Print out all items in the list

Create the following dictionary: 
apple:   1
salad:   3
chips:   2
cake:    9
yogurt:  2
peppers: 4
wine     12

27) Print out the number associated with cake
28) Print out the number associated with apple
29) Print out the number associated with wine
30) Prompt user for an item in the list, and print out the number associated with that item
31) Print out the length of the list
32) Write code to append an item to the dictionary. Append "carrots: 5"
33) Write code to iterate ofer the dictionary and print out each number associated with each item
