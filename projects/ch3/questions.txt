1)  Write a program that prompts the user to enter 3 grocery items, and puts them into a list. Then, print out the list in alphabetical order

2)  Write a program that initializes the following list:
  
    ['carrots', 'apples', 'kiwis', 'olive oil', 'coffee']
  
    Then prompt the user to enter an item and append it to the list.
    Print this new list in alphabetical order

3)  Prompt the user to enter 4 integers and place them into a list. Print out the reduced integer. "Reduction" can be achieved by building a pyramid with the original list as the base, and each subsequent row being the sum of the values in the row below. Example:

                 [     35      ] <-- reduced result
                 [   14  21    ]
                 [  4  10  11  ]     
    initial list: [ 3  1   9  2 ]

4)  Initialize the following dictionary:

    carrots   : 4.50
    apples    : 3.00
    kiwis     : 5.00
    olive oil : 9.99
    coffee    : 13.50

    Prompt the user to enter two items that are on sale, as well as their discounted prices. Then print out the new total

5)  Create a game where the user inputs 3 integers: a, b, and c. A new numbers is generated by performing a*b+c. Depending on if the number is odd or even, the values of a,b,c are updated differently:

    odd:
      a = a + 1
      b = b + 2
      c = c * 2
    even:
      a = b + 1
      b = c
      c = a (previous value of a)

    The game is over when the resulting number is greater than 1,000. Print out a,b,c for each iteration


6)  Extra Credit!
    Prompt the user for a string. Create an encoded list of numbers, where each number corresponds to that letter of the alphabet of the input string.
    Example:

    input string : Mipha
    encoded list : [13, 9, 16, 8, 1]

    Then, print out the sum and product of all values in the encoded list
